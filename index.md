## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 1

    I know this is the easiest and not that in depth of a lab, but the simplicity and core concept of what to come next is the most important. This lab introduces the basics of using github commands as well as setting up Visual Studio. Because of it, I got to know a better way to use github that I didn’t know from the last time I code in C++. And giving me a more convenient way to format my code without doing it manually.

* Lab 6, part 2

    All the lab previously has some fair share of challenges and tasks. But this part in particular challenges my logic ability and not just coding knowledge. It requires me to work with logic behind the game of blackjack and apply it into making a functional game of blackjack. Even if I’m good at coding but without the critical logic behind understanding blackjack, I might not finish this one.

* Lab 12, part 1

    This one is probably my favorite lab for introducing the use of class and function library. The Class use case through and through a must or core when it comes to coding using large number of variables or complex. But to use it in a way that you can manipulate position of a chart to change the color of an image. To loop it creating a short animation with combinations of different colors. Which is such an awesome way to animate something that I could never have thought up.
